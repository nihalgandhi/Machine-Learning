# Recognition of handwritten mathematical expression (Machine Learning)
Nowadays, the need for a user friendly system is increasing exponentially. It has been two decades since there has been no significant change in the old scientific calculator except for its hardware and speed. Our approach is to change the way the calculations are performed. These days, with the increasing use of smart phones, smarter ways of performing calculations can be achieved. Many-a-times people want to eliminate the extra step of entering the values into calculator to compute faster. In this work, the goal is to eliminate the current interface between handwritten information on paper and electronic media and automate the process to bring about large potential savings in terms of manual effort and speed. We introduce a system, which efficiently digitizes handwritten mathematical expressions and encompasses a set of algorithms for preprocessing, feature extraction and classification and thus, predicting and solving the expressions the features represent with considerable accuracy. The system can further be improvised to achieve a fully functional and accurate handwritten mathematical calculator.
